# Pothole-Detection
This project involves developing a real-time pothole detection system utilizing the YOLO v7 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, OpenCV for image processing, and a Raspberry Pi for deployment. The system is designed to alert users of potholes and store their locations in a database for further analysis and maintenance planning.
